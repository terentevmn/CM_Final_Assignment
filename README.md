# Final Assignment: A Single-Layer and a Multi-Layer Perceptron

**Course**: Cognitive Modelling (2022-2023)

**Student**: Maksim Terentev (2565137)

**Description**: This notebook is the final assignment of the Cognitive Modelling course, where we will build a single-layer perceptron and look at how it performs on binary classification tasks for two simple datasets (linary separable and non-lineary separable). Moreover, we will look at a more advanced feed-forward neural network called a multi-layer perceptron. The MLP will be used to learn non-linearly separable patterns. Finally, we will look at how the MLP performs on the brain activity data (EEGBCI dataset).

**Note**: The code of this project is based on [Multi-Layer Perceptron](https://clclab.github.io/FNCM/Lab4-MLP.html).
